description: "Herland is a utopian novel from 1915, written by feminist Charlotte\
  \ Perkins Gilman. The book describes an isolated society composed entirely of women,\
  \ who reproduce via parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction). The result is an ideal\
  \ social order: free of war, conflict, and domination. It first appeared as a serial\
  \ in The Forerunner, a magazine edited and written by Gilman between 1909 and 1916.\
  \ The book is the middle volume in her utopian trilogy; it was preceded by Moving\
  \ the Mountain (1911), and followed with a sequel, With Her in Ourland (1916). It\
  \ was not published in book form until 1979.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
